## hawthorn-mapping
The tree number coordinates, CRS system and dGPS status are in the first few columns and come directly from the dGPS export. The following columns are added manually.

Form – the tree type
  * m = multiple – where an individual is made up of multiple stems from the ground.
  * s = single – where an individual is comprised of a single main stem (this can split higher up, but so long as there is one main stem into the ground I’ve put it as single – more on this later).
  * b = bush or sapling – any individual that does not have a stem greater than 3cm circumference at breast height.
Reproductive – yes or no
Stem - This is only relevant where you have individuals that split below 1.3 meters.
I take a measurement just below the split – the main stem – and then take the measurements of the splits at breast height – secondary stems.
Status – additional tree information
  * H – tree is leaning or horizontal
  * Q – tree is broken above 1.3m  
  * D - tree is dead
  * Where you have multiple stems and only one is dead you can note which stem is dead
BHC – breast height circumference
  * If you’re using diameter tape you can ignore this column as you’ll get the BHD measurements as you do it.
BHD - breast height diameter (BHC/Pi)
  * Leave blank for saplings and main stems that split below 1.3m
  * For split stems - secondary stem measurements go in this column
Split height – height at which a main stem splits below 1.3m
Other BHC – circumference of stem at split height – ignore if using diameter tape.
Other BHD – diameter of stem at the specified split height
