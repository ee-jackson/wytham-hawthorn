## 2022-07-06
### EJ SG PF AB at Wytham
* PF will be conducting herbivory surveys and collecting fruits and seeds for insect rearing
* AB is continuing with conspecific tree mapping whilst MG is away
* developed herbivory protocol:
  * surveys will be conducted on each of the focal trees, one or two nearest neighbours and potentially some individuals in areas of known high and low conspecific densities
  * haphazardly select 10 (non tagged) branches on each tree
  * count 50 leaves on each of the branches from the tip of the branch moving inwards
  * if herbivory is present on a leaf collect it in a zip lock bag 
  * keep separate zip lock bags per branch with ID numbers as "`tree_id` - 1, 2, 3... 10"
  * transfer leaves to small paper envelopes, record a count of: # of leaves collected, # small green leaf folds, # mines, # tent-like leaf folds (this list can be extended based on types of herbivory commonly found in the samples/easily identified)
  * keep all small (branch level) envelopes in a larger (tree level) envelope
  * leaves will be lightly pressed under a box until we purchase a plant press
  * % herbivory estimates will be calculated at a later date from the dry leaves - perhaps using image software e.g. LeafByte or ImageJ
* Haws that were planted 2022-03-12 for a germination pilot have not germinated. Think it is now unlikely that they will germinate this year if at all. For any future attempt I will follow the stratification method detailed in [Persson _et al._](https://doi.org/10.15258/sst.2006.34.3.04). 

## 2022-06-17 Friday
### EJ at Wytham
* counted initial fruit set on branches of marked individuals and removed bags

## 2022-05-13 Friday
### EJ at Wytham
* counted initial fruit set on branches of marked individuals and removed bags
* removed any fruits left over from last year to avoid confusion when counting ripe fruits at the end of summer

## 2022-05-13 Friday
### EJ MG at Wytham
* counted flowers as yesterday, ST will continue next week
* pots of collected fruits and seeds were left in the sun and many melted
  * can't be sure nothing escaped
  * also possible that the heat has killed any developing pupae
  * relocated the contents into new pots
  * some of the lids popped off (5 pots) so could be labelled wrong

## 2022-05-12 Thursday
### ST EJ MG at Wytham
* visited focal trees to count flowers and do pollinator surveys
* if no flowers on marked unbagged branches, counted other branches (and marked them G, H or I) or branches of neighbouring trees (trees marked as: focal tree number _point_ 1, 2 or 3)
* damaged flowers were included in the count of total flowers and also counted separately
* counted as damaged if reproductive parts of flower were no longer viable/visible

## 2022-05-11 Wednesday
* started counting diptera larvae in pots of Haws collected Autumn 2021 from nearest neighbour
  * found some wasps - look parasitoid 

## 2022-05-09 Monday
### ST EJ MG at Wytham
* visited 10 focal trees to count flowers and do pollinator surveys
* on 5/10 trees visited, tagged branches had no flowers - in future trips I will try counting flowers of nearby trees
* there were herbivores inside some of the bags, mostly caterpillars which were probably there when the bags were added
* noticed many flowers were damaged, possibly _Anthonomus pedicularius_ or _Anthonomus bituberculatus_
  * would be good to count number of damaged flowers separately to total flower count
* branch beating for pollinators went well, noticed more insects fell from flowering trees
* flower visitor observations were not as successful, for the majority of surveys no flower visitors were recorded
  * possible that pollinators prefer flowers higher up where we cannot observe them
* conspecific density mapping is taking longer than expected, took 2-3 days to map 50m2 radius of one tree
* approx 300 individuals were mapped in the 50m2 radius of the first tree (ID 33)

## 2022-05-03 Tuesday
### SG ST MG EJ CF at Wytham
* Trialled protocols for mapping conspecific density with the dGPS and for pollinator study
* Visited some focal trees and noticed that quite a few haven't flowered
* The pollinator exclusion bag on branch C on tree 6 was open - but did not contain flowers
* Whole tree phenology scoring - no flowers, majority buds, majority open flowers
* mapping conspecific density:
  * dense bramble undergrowth made mapping difficult MG will start at trees with easier terrain and we will hire some short-term field assistants for extra help with those trees
  * dGPS data can be taken at three different resolutions - FIX: 2 cm resolution, FLOAT: 1 m resolution, SINGLE: ~ 5 m (regular gps accuracy). Will try and get FIX when possible but FLOAT also acceptable
  * multi-stem trees: keep a note about how many stems smaller than 5cm dbh (as in the ForestGEO protocol) + measure the circumference of the biggest stem
* pollinator study:
  * ST will beat 3 branches of two nearest conspecific neighbours to focal trees (one flowering, one not flowering) for 5 beats each
  * the two conspecific neighbours will also be tagged and co-ordinates recorded
  * will record whether the tree is  in flower
  * ST will observe flower visitors to focal trees in a 1 m2 area for 5 mins

## 2022-04-07 Thursday
### EJ and ST at Wytham
* finished bagging branches for pollinator exclusion
* visited 14 trees and bagged three branches each: 11, 32, 15, 14, 19, 18, 16, 17, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4
* many trees did not have flower buds yet - we will have to hope that the branches we have bagged will produce flowers this year
* Hawthorn is very visible this time of year and not much else is in leaf - looked like Hawthorn density was very high in the woods. I think it will be important to note which trees have produced flowers and/or fruit when mapping for conspecific density
* branch 11G replaces 11C

## 2022-04-06 Wednesday
### EJ and ST at Wytham
* visited 11 trees and bagged three branches each: 24, 22, 33, 21, 30, 35, 28, 27, 34, 25, 29
* tree 26 was falling over - tagged and bagged a new tree nearby ID 34
* tree 23 had branches knocked off by foresters - tagged and bagged a new tree nearby ID 35
* branch 30G replaces 30B

## 2022-04-05 Tuesday
### EJ at Wytham
* started bagging branches with netting, mesh size: 0.28mm x 0.79mm
* recorded a rough measure of phenology (early, mid, late) and took a photo of each branch
* many trees had a mix of phenology with some branches more advanced than others
* used a cable tie to secure to branch and closed edges with staples
* bagged 3 branches from each of 7 trees: 5, 13, 12, 31, 8, 7, 6
* bagged branches A, B, C except in cases where branch was no longer suitable - in these cases I would tag a new branch, G
* bag for 6C included neighbouring branch as difficult to bag without it
* for tree 13 bagged branches A, B, E, not C

## 2022-03-12 Saturday
* Planted out Hawthorn seeds for germination pilot
  * 46 were sown as is
  * 46 were sown after soaking in water overnight and removal of pulp
  * Seed trays with soaked & pulp removed seeds are indicated with a stick in the top left corner

## 2022-03-11 Friday
* Compiled a table of host-specific arthropod Hawthorn fruit and seed eaters
  * going off of photographs, I'm fairly confident we have *Anomoia purmunda* and *Blastodacna hellerella* larvae in the rearing pots

## 2022-03-10 Thursday
* Checked insect rearing pots
  * Mice have found and eaten most horse chestnut seeds
  * Found one weevil (*Sitona sp.*?) in pot of hornbeam seeds trapped between the mesh and the lid. Unsure if it actually came from the seeds.
  * Saw one large grub in pot of oak seeds (pot 28, acorn weevil larvae?), did not collect
  * 3 cocoons in pot of Ash seeds, did not collect
* Researched Hawthorn germination
  * Best method seems to be Bujarska-Borkowska (2002), cold and then warm stratification to break dormancy -> 90% germination
  * For the pilot will try simply planting out this week, as stratification will take too long. They were collected in Jan  and been kept outside so have experienced some cold.

## 2022-03-07 Monday

### EJ at Wytham
* 7th survey
* tree 23 has been knocked down, was able to collect data from 2 branches that were still intact
  * they are going to coppice it and hopefully it will grow back in the Spring
* Also collected a small number of fruits (<100) from non-focal individuals for a pilot germination experiment
  * was not able to collect many as there are not many fruits around

* 4th survey
* collected 100 fruits from each focal tree's nearest neighbour for insect rearing

## 2021-09-29 Wednesday
### EJ & SG at Wytham
* 3rd survey
* finished adding wire mesh cages around Hawthorn branches and counting fruits
* one of the focal trees had been cut down

## 2021-09-28 Tuesday
### EJ & SG at Wytham
* 3rd survey
* continued adding wire mesh cages around Hawthorn branches and counting fruits

## 2021-09-27 Monday
### EJ & SG at Wytham
* 3rd survey
* started adding wire mesh cages around Hawthorn branches
  * cages around 3 branches and labelled and counted fruits on 3 extra branches per tree

## 2021-09-17 Friday
### Meeting: SG, EJ, JB & TO
* Should we exclude vertebrates from all focal branches?
  * could be interesting to look at bird dispersal but we would need more than 3 branches
  * when we next go out we could label and count fruit on another 3 branches to compare to caged branches
* How to measure Hawthorn density?
  * belt transects
  * get a dgps? - accurate to 2cm!
* adjacent project for a MSc student looking at pollination limitation
  * they could measure additional variables like canopy cover & altitude and conduct observations of visiting pollinators

## 2021-09-13 Monday
### EJ & SG at Wytham
* Spent a full day collecting seeds and fruits for insect rearing
* tested vertebrate exclusion cage around branches using chicken wire

## 2021-09-02 Thursday
### EJ at Wytham
* Completed 2nd survey of focal Hawthorn individuals

## 2021-08-24 Tuesday
### Meeting: SG & EJ
* Can still consider rearing insects from focal trees - unmarked branches
  * possible for trees which have a lot of fruit -predispersal or/and collect from the ground
  * could compare insect abundance in pre and post dispersal fruits
* Vertebrate exclusion
  * could use something firm like chicken wire to create a cage around the branches e.g. Beckman & Muller-Landau 2011
  * There might be a bird box hole size guide or something that we can use to inform choice of mesh size for the chicken wire
  * Sorensen 1981 Wytham study suggests birds aren't feeding heavily on Hawthorn till October
  * Get something in place before the end of September?
* To do:
  * explore vertebrate exclusion methods in the literature
  * write up notes on questions to answer and analysis methods we might use

## 2021-08-06 Friday
### EJ at Wytham
* Second day counting fruits for 1st survey
  * visited trees in the Eastern part of the woods which I did not reach yesterday

## 2021-08-05 Thursday
### EJ at Wytham
* First day counting fruits for 1st survey
  * tried to visit all focal trees in one day but was unsuccessful
  * might be quicker the next time around as I won't need to choose branches
  * large variation in the amount of fruit on each tree, the sample size for some will be small

## 2021-08-02 Monday
### EJ at Wytham
* mapped more hawthorn
  * Walked the eastern trails - Pasticks and Marley wood

## 2021-07-29 Thursday
### EJ at Wytham
* mapped more hawthorn
  * Covered trails in the southern area of the woods - Rough Copse, Guy's Copse, Songers Copse, Radbrook Common

## 2021-07-27 Tuesday
### EJ at Wytham
* mapped more hawthorn
  * Covered trails around Wytham Hill and Woodcroft Copse

## 2021-07-20 Tuesday
### EJ at Wytham
* started mapping hawthorn
  * many hawthorn also did not produce fruit, however as they are so common it should still be possible to get a good sample size
  * covered all trails in the Great Wood, north of Lord's Common and tagged trees with fruits close to the trail
  * only found four but I think they are rarer in this part of the woods
  * some fruits were turning red but did not look ripe - still small and hard. Found on branches and on the ground under trees
* discussing with SG: how can we distinguish between missing fruits which have dispersed and missing fruits which have dropped prematurely? Fruits look like they're maturing at different rates, even on the same branch
  * netting that is big enough for insects to get through but small enough to trap fruits?
* Reading https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13554
  * Lit says that hawthorn have very little variability in fruiting between years and no evidence of masting. Why then have so many not fruited? Too young (can take between 5 and 8 years till first fruit)? Adverse weather over the past year? They are not very shade tolerant - is it too shady in the woods to produce fruit on the lower branches?
* Fruit should ripen from August through to September and remain on the trees through to at least December

## 2021-07-15 Thursday
### EJ at Wytham
* visited 20 focal blackthorn with the intention of beginning fruit counting/monitoring. Of the 20 trees visited, 
  * 4 have become inaccessible due to large ferns/brambles/nettle 
  * 8 had no fruit
  * individuals which did have fruits had very few, approx 10 per branch
* Will try to switch to Hawthorn as focal species as they had many more fruits
  * next week start mapping out focal individuals, aim for ~ 40

## 2021-06-08 Tuesday
### Meeting: SG & EJ
* Aim to have ethanol filled vials ready in the next 2 weeks
  * SG emailed Yves Basset who recommended 95% ethanol
  * EJ to email Soon Gweon about lab space and equipment for ethanol dilution
* Will start collecting fruits at Wytham opportunistically
  * set limits, e.g. one day every 2 weeks, max 50 seeds from an individual and max 5 individuals per sp per sampling date
  * collect fruits in sandwich bags
  * fruits from one individual can go in the same bag
  * record gps coordinates, pre-dispersal or post-dispersal, size/developmental stage of fruits (could take a photo of fruit next to a ruler)

## 2021-05-26 Tuesday
### EJ & SG at Wytham
* found, mapped, and re-tagged trees 002, 003, 004, 012, 014 & 017. We now have all the focal blackthorn on the GPS
* found and mapped blackthorn 026 - a new one
* did not re-tag 012 with a pink label as terrain was very difficult. Will probably discard this one
* started mapping & tagging some hawthorn: 001H, 003H, 026H, 017H, 002H, 004H, 012H
  * most mapped hawthorn were next to a focal blackthorn, but we also mapped some that were in areas of the woods for which we have no blackthorn - thinking that we will have a larger sample size of hawthorn than blackthorn
  * Hawthorn is in flower now but should be easy to find even when not in flower, so we weren't exhaustive in mapping
* Think we should wait to start mapping Rosaceae around focals as some focal trees may not end up being suitable e.g. don't produce enough/any fruits

## 2021-05-18 Friday
### Meeting: SG & EJ
* non-focal tree fruit collection for insect rearing can be less systematic, but should record: 
  * date
  * co-ordinates
  * species
  * number of fruits
  * fruit mature or immature
  * notes e.g. approx size of the fruits
* all fruits from the same tree individual can be put in the same rearing pot
* need to buy rearing pots - SG used little deli pots in Panama
* cut a hole in the lid and used netting in between lid and pot, easier than elastic bands which tended to break
* for the netting, this: https://www.watdon.co.uk/cgi-bin/sh000088.cgi?WD=netting&PN=E6650%2dfine%2dnetting%2dper%2dmetre%2ehtml#SID=20
* a couple of layers of tissue paper at the bottom of the pots to absorb moisture - in Panama some insects liked hiding in it after emerging
* could also order some forceps for moving insects to vials
* build some kind of shelving for storing the insect pots outdoors? + rain cover
* need to order screw top vials (eppendorfs leak) and ethanol for storage of insects for identification
* if we are reasonably sure that some individual insects are the same species could just keep one of each and return others to the forest?

## 2021-05-14 Friday
### Meeting: SG, EJ, JB & TO
Thinking about mapping Rosaceae: 
* could do a belt transect rather than mapping every individual - walk down the middle of a circular transect and record individuals within ~3m of the transect. Then repeat for different radii.
* could walk transects at North, South, East and West
* problem that we don't know dispersal distances of Chalcid wasps

Thinking about finding Torymus varians: 
* Info online is scarce. Could check with people at BWARS (Bees, Wasps, & Ants Recording Society) to see if they have any info on Torymus varians distributions / sightings.
* Liam Crowley told us he had observed Torymus varians on Hawthorn in Birmingham
* We could also track Hawthorn fruits to cover all bases
* If we paired each Blackthorn to a Hawthorn nearby they may be able to share mapping data? Would then have a location random effect
* Might be a good idea to get extra insect rearing pots so we can see what might be predating other Rosaceae spp. - Cherry, Apple, Dogrose, Damson

## 2021-05-12 Wednesday
### EJ spent the day at Wytham
* Re-marked 9 focal trees with the GPS and replaced red ribbons with pink plant tags
  * tree ids: 001, 015, 005, 008, 007, 019, 018, 006, 020
  * 19 out of 25 trees have now been re-marked 
* Additionally, marked 3 branches on 6 focal trees and counted flowers (flowers are brown, stamen still visible, sometimes small green fruits)
  * tree ids: 001, 015, 005, 008, 007, 021
  * recorded number of flowers and distance from branch tip to label
  * flowers between branch tip and label were counted
  * label was placed at a distance that gave around 30 flowers
* was not able to count flowers on all re-marked trees as branches with flowers were either too high or not visible
  * 018 - branches were too high and really difficult to access
  * 020 - no flowers, small tree near duck pond
  * 006 - no flowers
  * 019 - only one branch in reach with flowers, which I did count
* I looked for trees 003, 002 and 017, and couldn't find them
* 6 trees remaining to re-mark: 002, 003, 004, 012, 014, 017

## 2021-05-11 Tuesday
### Meeting: SG & EJ
* Thinking it might be a good idea to start counting flowers - could then look at number of flowers vs fruit set - give an idea of pollination success?
* not sure on the practicalities yet - will reassess when next in Wytham
* survey 3 branches per focal tree. Maybe 20/30cm from each branch tip? Find a distance that will give approx 100 flowers per tree or ~ 30 per branch
* could look into buying a tally counter - there is probably a phone app

## 2021-04-30 Friday
### EJ spent the day at Wytham
* Re-marking focal trees with the GPS and replacing red ribbons with pink plant tags. Pink plant tags have initials EJ and tree ID written in sharpie
* did this for 10 trees (ids: 016, 021, 022, 010, 011, 023, 024, 025, 090, 013)
* Blackthorn have now lost most of their white petals which made them much harder to find
* tagged 1 extra focal tree near Bean Wood

## 2021-04-27 Tuesday
### Meeting: SG & EJ
Next steps: 
  * re-map with GPS and look for more focal trees
  * start mapping Rosaceae 50m around focal trees
  * fill in Wytham research form
  * write prelim protocol

Need to order 
now:
  * batteries AA x2 and screen protecters for GPS
  * tags and sharpies for marking branches

later:
  * insect rearing pots and mesh (tights?), elastic bands
  * rain cover
  * netting for bagging branches
  
## 2021-04-22 Thursday
### EJ spent the day at Wytham
* Some areas in the north of the woods have no visible Blackthorn for miles (incl. Smithsonian plot)
* Tagged trees #16 to #21

## 2021-04-20 Tuesday
### EJ & SG spent the day at Wytham
* Tagged 18 blackthorn with red ribbon
* Set a pin on google maps to help find them again
* Recorded stem circumference at breast height and degree of isolation (how many other blackthorn could we see at this location)
* Notes are in Sofia's notebook
* May change focal individuals later, but we wanted to find some whilst they are still in flower - easy to spot from a distance
* Tags #1 to #15 and Sofia1, Sofia 1a, Sofia2

## 2021-04-16 Friday
### EJ & SG spent the day at Wytham with Keith Kirby
* Decided that Cherry was too rare - only saw 2 clusters
* Blackthorn looked more promising
